The Cloud Aerosol Lidar for Global Scale Observations of the Ocean-Land-Atmosphere System (CALIGOLA) is the primary instrument of an upcoming satellite mission being led by the Italian Space Agency (ASI).  The mission is currently in Phase A of implementation.  Beginning in 2022, ASI and NASA began discussing the potential of CALIGOLA being a joint agency mission.  As of summer 2023, this partnership is going forward.  ASI will be responsible for providing the laser system, satellite platform, spacecraft, and launch vehicle while NASA will be responsible for providing the detector system, ground stations, data handling, and data storage.  CALIGOLA lasers are being developed by Leonardo and will have emissions at 355, 532, and 1064 nm.  Details of the detector system are still being evaluated, but discussions during 2022 and early 2023 included as many as 11 channels (317, 355, 405, 450, 466, 532, and 1064 nm co-polarized and 355, 532, and 1064 nm cross-polarized).
An official CALIGOLA website has not yet been created.
